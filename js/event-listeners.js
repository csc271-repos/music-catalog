/* 
  TO DO: 
  
      1) Copy and paste BOTH functions you wrote back in the html-event-handlers.js script.

      2) Loop through all records in the third row. For each record, do the following:
         a) Add an event listener so that when clicked: 
            Get its Spotify track ID saved as its attribute.
            Pass this ID as an argument to the appropriate function to update the track of the player. 
      
      3) Add an event listener to the close button so that when clicked it calls the appropriate function
         to close the Spotify embedded player.
